          <p>
            I am currently carrying out a clear objective: insert myself into IT
            world. That's why I took my first steps as a "Full Stack Web
            Developer" with Henry. My life experiences have given me great
            decision-making and leadership skills, as well as the need to test
            myself in changing situations and acquire essential knowledge on my
            own. I found in web development and the IT universe my true passion.
